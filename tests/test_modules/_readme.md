Eventually this should contain a rough mirror of the folder structure of Pyfa.  Each file is used to test a matching file in Pyfa.

For some files (notably `config.py`), we will need to test file formatting that will require a separate file.  Simply name the file to match, and append a brief description (example:  `test_config_cp1251.py` to test formatting using the `cp1251` codec.)
